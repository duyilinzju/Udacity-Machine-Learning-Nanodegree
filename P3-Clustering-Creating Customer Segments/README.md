## Project: Creating Customer Segments

### Summary
- Apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
- Interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
- Analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
- Optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.


### Code

This project contains three files:

- `customer_segments.ipynb`: main analysis
- `customers.csv`: The project dataset
- `visuals.py`: supplementary visualizations 

### Data

The customer segments data is included as a selection of 440 data points collected on data found from clients of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal. More information can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).

Note (m.u.) is shorthand for *monetary units*.
