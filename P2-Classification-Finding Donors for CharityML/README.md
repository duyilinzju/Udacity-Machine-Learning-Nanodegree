## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

### Summary
- Data preprocessing: Normalizing, One-Hot Encoding, Transforming Skewed Features
- Establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem
- Create a training and prediction Pipeline
- Tune and Evaluate several supervised learning algorithms: GradientBoosting, GaussianNB, DecisionTree
- Investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.


### Code

This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: main file for analysis
- `census.csv`: The project dataset
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code


### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
